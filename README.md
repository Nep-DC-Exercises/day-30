# PostgreSQL Exercises

## Date: 10/9/19 W7 D3 D30

### Summary

This repo contains practice SQL queries. At this point, we are familiarizing ourselves with PostgreSQL as it will be our main database for the rest of class.

What did I learn?

* using the createdb command to create a database 
* creating tables (using terminal and Postico GUI)
* updating data within tables
* writing queries to request specific views and combinations of data
* adding constraints to fields 
* how to include foreign key references
* escaping a ' in SQL is simply '' instead of \' in other languages
